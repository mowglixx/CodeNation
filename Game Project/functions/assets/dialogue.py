    # (YES/NO)

    "What's the matter, dear? You look like you've seen a ghost! Can I help you with anything? ...Oh, I see. That Princess Footstool is one clumsy tart. I did see her run off with a rather imposing figure. I could tell you where they went... But my short-term memory only works when people can finish Christmas song lyrics for me. I know, it sounds insane. Just go with it.",

    # (MISSING WORD CHALLENGE)

    f"Bingo! Now I remember! She went towards the village! Run! Save her! Please! She owes me fifty quid. I don't care if she is the princess, I'm not letting her get away with that. Have a safe trip {player_name}!",

    "You make your way towards the village. Hopefully, the old woman wasn't completely insane! ...wait! ...what is that? There's something on the floor...",

    f"Congratulations {player_name}! You won a sword! You can use this to fight enemies... or steal from off licences!",

    "You make your way towards the village. But it's eerily quiet. Nobody is around. A cold wind blows through your hair, and you feel something is amiss. You look around to see what's wrong. Is it the bitter chill in the air? Maybe it's the empty shops. Could it be the stone-cold silence? Oh! it's just a lion sitting on a bench. He signals you to come and sit with him.",

    # (YES/NO)

    f"Take a seat, mon amis. My super lion senses tell me you're looking for someone. You may have already assumed I'm quite the hunter, and you'd be right. The fact you've come and sat next to me Makes me think you'd appreciate my assistance. Would you like my help?",

    # (YES/NO)

    f"Marvellous. Of course, I would ask for you to scratch my back before I scratch yours. You see, us lions are losing faith in you humans, as you call yourselves. Primarily because too many of you lot keep trying to stick our heads on walls, but also, we don't think you humans are very good at riddles unlike us furry bois. I'm going to give you a riddle.

    f"You go to the phonebox and step inside. The phonebox starts to shake! The light from outside is blinding! You close your eyes until the shaking and rattling finally stops. Everything settles down. Your eyes slowly open, and there it is â€“ {villan_name}'s castle. Princess Footstool must be inside! Let's go! ...well? Open the door then! ...oh no. It's locked.
